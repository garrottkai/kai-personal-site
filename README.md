## Milestone 1 Feedback 
Excellent job. Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all well defined. +1 for adding CSS! Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.
