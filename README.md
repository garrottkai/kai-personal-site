Repository for personal website project

## Milestone 1 Feedback 
Excellent job. Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all well defined. +1 for adding CSS! Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Really nice work Kai - your site map, content strategy and interaction flow are all well defined, and your wireframes are well-built and sufficiently detailed as to provide you with a good guide for your front end development.

Keeping your contact info in the footer is a good idea - but plan to also include an HTML contact form somewhere in your site. This is a PWP requirement, and will be PHP driven using Swiftmailer. Having the footer fixed to the bottom of your pages is easy with CSS. This is a great design consideration for your mobile users.

A jQuery driven gallery plugin that many students have had success with is the [Swipebox Gallery](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/). We like it because  it works well on mobile and is Bootstrap friendly.

Your HTML and CSS are excellent. Looking forward to seeing your project take shape.

Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP.
